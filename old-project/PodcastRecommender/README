README

I decided to include my old source code if anyone wants to take a look at it. As 
I said, it's a rough first pass, and hasn't been fully documented or prepared for
public consumption. But, it may be of some interest.

I created two modified files that I used recently to scrape the iTunes feeds and
podcast data to generate our sample data:

* scraper/ItunesFeedUrlLookup.java 
	- gets the feed url from the iTunes API using iTunes id's in database.
* scraper/FeedParser.java 
	- takes the feed urls from database and scrapes the RSS feed, saving to database

Obviously, the database is local on my machine, so these won't be of any use
until we re-write them to read from / save to file, or have some other solution.

The FeedParser, especially, could be re-written to read from the feed_url.csv file
in the data/ folder.
