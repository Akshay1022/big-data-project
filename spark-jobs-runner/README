The project uses Maven, so you'll need to install that first.

You'll also want to install MongoDB if you want to run locally, and you will need to start the mongodb process in order
to actually save to and read form the db:

    $ mongod

When you want to build a jar using Maven use:

    $ mvn clean
    $ mvn compile
    $ mvn package

and the packaged "fat" jar should appear in the target/ folder.
